### Assignment 1-2
##### Coding (Stock Transactions)
For the second half of your assignment this week we need to get down to writing some code.

Follow the same process from Assignment 1 Github to clone and save your code in a feature branch on your fork. You will then open a PR with your source code for review.

##### Here is what you will build:
###### Stock Transaction Program
Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of the purchase:
- The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.
- When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $45.50 per share.
- Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2% of the amount he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
- The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.
- He sold the stock for $56.90 per share.
- He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2% of the amount
he received for the stock.

Write a program that displays the following information:
- The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
- The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
- The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
- The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
- Display the amount of profit that Joe made after selling his stock and paying the two commissions to his broker. (If the amount of profit that your program displays is a negative number, then Joe lost money on the transaction.)

##### How to write the program:
- Use Named Constants for things like:
  - SHARES_BOUGHT
  - SHARES_SOLD
  - COMMISSION_RATE
  - PURCHASE_PRICE
  - SALE_PRICE
- Place all of your logic in the main function
